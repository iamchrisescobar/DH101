# GitHub Pages Starter: Social Networks & Mental Health

This is a Jekyll starter for your project site. It includes:
- Shared layout and responsive styles
- Pages: Home, About Us, Data Critique, History, Bibliography
- A11y friendly header and mobile nav
- Reusable team cards and content blocks

## Quick Start
1. Create a new GitHub repo (public is fine). Name can be anything. If you use `username.github.io`, set `baseurl: ""`.
2. Download this zip, extract it, and push the files to the repo root.
3. In GitHub: Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` / root. Save.
4. If your repo is not `username.github.io`, set `baseurl` in `_config.yml` to `"/<reponame>"`.
5. Edit the `.md` pages and `assets/css/style.css` as needed.

## Editing
- Navigation is controlled in `_config.yml` under `nav:`.
- Shared layout is `_layouts/default.html` with `_includes/header.html` and `_includes/footer.html`.
- Styles live in `assets/css/style.css`.
- Team cards and tables on About are examples; duplicate to add members and roles.

## Notes
- Keep alt text on images and use headings in order.
- Cite course readings on the About page in the Presentation section.
- Add your data critique content under the Data Critique page.
